# fraud-detection-explainable-llm
This project implements a fraud detection system using the Credit Card Behaviour Score dataset from Kaggle. It combines a traditional fraud detection model (Random Forest) with various explainability techniques (SHAP, LIME, PDP, etc.) and leverages a local open source LLM (Llamaâ€‘2) to generate plain-language explanations for flagged transactions.
